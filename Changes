1.01  Changed the way error checking works.  Rather than checking if
      if the function returns undef (which is wrong) we check if
      $untaint->error is set (which is right)

      Changed the diagnostics.  Now if the extraction fails rather
      than printing out that the result is undef rather than what
      we expected we print out the error message

      Fixed a grammar error in one of the error messages.

      Improved the test suite to test above changes.

1.00  Initial release to CPAN
